# GeminiAgent

GeminiAgent is an **educational Python project** designed to explore file system interactions, directory traversal, and file writing functionality.  
It includes helper functions like `write_file`, `get_file_content`, and `get_files_info` for safely inspecting and manipulating files within a working directory.
